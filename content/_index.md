As a self-driven and curious sophomore at Northeastern University, I am pursuing a combined major of Computer Science and Criminal Justice, a combination that positions me at the fascinating intersection of technology and justice systems. My interests lie in leveraging software development and data analysis to create meaningful solutions that can impact both the tech industry and public safety sectors.

Currently maintaining a 4.0 GPA and recognized on the Dean's List, I bring hands-on experience from my internship at The Hospital for Sick Children, where I developed a COVID-19 mental health platform that attracted over 3,000 participants. As a full-stack developer with experience in TypeScript, React, AWS, and Microsoft Azure, I'm seeking co-op opportunities where I can apply my technical skills and collaborative approach in real-world settings. If you're looking for a motivated developer with a proven track record and genuine enthusiasm for solving complex problems, I'd love to connect through my [Email](mailto:han.yuxu@northeastern.edu)!
