Unfortunately, our school clubs were not managed thoroughly and were not secure, and trolls and anonymous users will often disrupt the club on the club Discord server. That&rsquo;s when the idea for EntryEmail was conceived.</p><h2 id=what-it-does>What it does</h2><p>Since clubs mostly take place in discord servers, we believed that our project should be related to discord. So we created a discord bot that allows for secure verification in the form of email. EntryEmail is a safe and efficient bot that allows for the denial of bots and trolls. This system restricts access and inspection of certain discord channels. The way to unlock this system would be to verify your email with the school domain and retrieve the code. This code can be entered into the bot, granting you full access to the discord server. This process ensures complete security and guarantees that your discord server cannot be intruded upon. The bot also allows for other features, such as customizing a list of domains you wish to enter, which can filter through bots and trolls. Moderators can also inspect the emails of users that enter to verify them more. EntryEmail is easy to deploy and is a great way to establish an advanced safeguard which protects data privacy and privacy in general for school clubs and communities.</p><h2 id=how-we-built-it>How we built it</h2><p>EntryEmail was created with typescript discord.js, SMTPsender, and firebase. We chose firebase as the backend server because it&rsquo;s highly scalable and provides easy access worldwide. In addition, we want to ensure the simplicity of deploying the bot for moderators because privacy concerns are often one of the biggest threats among club leaders.</p><h2 id=accomplishments-that-were-proud-of>Accomplishments that we&rsquo;re proud of</h2><p>We are proud that we made a functioning bot ready for production scenarios. We learned many new concepts during the hackathon and made the bot highly modular, meaning that it can be easily converted to other databases or social media.</p><h2 id=what-we-learned>What we learned</h2><p>We expanded our knowledge in typescript and firebase. We also learned how to create a discord bot effectively. We also managed to learn the firestore API and produce well-written codes with it.</p><h2 id=whats-next-for-entrymail>What&rsquo;s next for EntryMail</h2><p>We are really emphatic on broadening our demographic to possibly other discord servers and making it a universal bot. We have immense ambition and passion for making this bot a useful tool for everyone in the discord community. We plan on trying to help people with privacy matters as that is an important issue people deal with daily. We are proud to have created this bot to assist people that require a safe platform to perform their work or recreation.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class=footer><div class=inner><a href=https://github.com/yuxuan-steve-han/yuxuan-steve-han.github.io>Source</a>
